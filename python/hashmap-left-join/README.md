# Challenge Summary

-   Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.

-   Write a function called left join

-[x] Arguments: two hash maps

-   The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.

-   The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.

-[x] Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesnâ€™t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic
